2. Network Anomalies: PCAP contains 1007 packets (TCP=532, UDP=380, ICMP=0, ARP=95).
3. System Status: Log and PCAP data reviewed for SSH and basic L3/L4 activity.

Recommendations:
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for SSH where possible.
- Disable direct root login over SSH and enforce key-based authentication.
- Investigate and, if appropriate, block IPs showing sustained brute-force behavior.
- Maintain regular system updates and log/PCAP review procedures.
